🚀 Smart Travel Planner with Traffic Simulation & Automation
An interactive map-based route planner that helps users optimize city-to-city travel using intelligent graph algorithms like Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, MST, and custom multi-city optimizations.

🌐 Features:

Interactive city and route builder on a Leaflet-based map

Real-time traffic simulation based on time of day

Route visualization with traffic-aware weights and legends

Support for Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall, Prim’s MST, and travel optimization

Save/load graph data directly to/from backend storage.

📦 Automation-ready: Frontend data now prepared to integrate with backend APIs for automatic pathfinding, traffic updates, and graph management.

🔧 Upcoming / Automation Additions:

Backend integration using Flask/C++ for real-time algorithm execution

Auto-run selected algorithm and fetch results using POST requests

Automated traffic re-routing and alternate path suggestions

Scheduled or trigger-based updates (e.g., traffic change every hour)

🗂️ Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js

Backend (planned): Flask (Python) or C++ CLI with JSON I/O

Visualization: OpenStreetMap + Leaflet

Data Format: GeoJSON + Custom Graph JSON
